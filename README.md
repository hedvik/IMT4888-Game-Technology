# IMT4888 Game Technology Project Repository - Unity ECS, Job System and Burst
## What is this repository?
* A repository used for testing the performance between regular Unity and the new ECS package that currently is available in preview.
* The test consists of simulating a animated galaxy with large amounts of spherical stars. 

## Unused Code
* Originally, the plan was to compare pathfinding between standard Unity and the ECS version as a new AI API by Unity allows ECS to interface with it. 
* This was scrapped fairly early on as there was too little documentation on how the new AI API worked so I could not get anything to run properly. Instead, I moved on to a simpler test scenario with transform manipulation for visual effects. The original pathfinding code still exists in the project repository, but it is not used.
