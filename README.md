# IMT4888 Game Technology Project Repository - Unity ECS, Job System and Burst
## What is this repository?
* A repository used for testing the performance between regular Unity and the new ECS package that currently is available in preview.
* The test consists of simulating a animated galaxy with large amounts of spherical stars. 

## Unused Code
* Code related to the pathfinding scene is unused as these are leftovers from the initial plan for ECS testing that didn't work out.
